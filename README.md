# yb-http

yb-http is a lightweight and easy use webserver. It is very fast, 
because it is based on fiber. 
In future releases, I will add a webinterface. Trough it you can manage your Webserver very quick.


## Usage
yb-http is made for the use behind a reverse proxy. Because yb-http does not include
encryption via SSL or TLS it is insecure to use it without an proxy with encryption.
